# Lucas Kaíque

Hey, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Dev em Dobro and a freelancer at Duo Studio, where my passion for problem-solving and elegant design comes to life. Specializing in Back-end technologies like NodeJS, C#, and Go, I also excel in crafting beautiful front-end experiences with React and Next.js. My focus is on creating robust, efficient, and user-friendly applications that enhance user interaction and deliver value.

Beyond the realm of coding, I have a vibrant career as a DJ and event producer. These roles bring out my creative flair, giving me the opportunity to orchestrate memorable experiences through music and events. This juxtaposition of analytical coding and artistic production skills shapes my unique approach to my work, allowing me to bring fresh, innovative ideas to the table.

Whether you're looking for a sophisticated software solution or an unforgettable event, I'm your go-to professional. I'm eager to leverage my distinct skills to deliver exceptional results.
